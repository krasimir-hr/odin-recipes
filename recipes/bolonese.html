    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This spaghetti bolognese is a pasta sauce that everyone should have up their sleeve. Simple ingredients married perfectly and simmered to perfection to create a rich and luscious ragu</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground pork and beef</li>
        <li>Pancetta</li>
        <li>Soffritto</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Rosemary and sage</li>
        <li>White wine</li>
        <li>Whole milk</li>
        <li>Chicken borth</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven (or other large pot) on a medium-high heat, fry the pancetta in olive oil until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside</li>
        <li>Lower to a medium heat and in the pancetta fat gently fry the onion, celery and carrot mixture until soft. After five minutes add the herbs, garlic and a big pinch of salt and black pepper. Cook gently for another 5 mins.</li>
        <li>Add the ground meat and pancetta and mix the tomato paste through, cooking for 3 - 4 mins making sure the meat is well broken up with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Add the wine and let it reduce for a few minutes. It doesn't have to be fully reduced.</li>
        <li>Add the stock and milk, bring to a simmer then turn the heat down to it's lowest and cook uncovered for 2.5 - 3 hours. Barely at a simmer, just a few bubbles.</li>
        <li>It will be reduced down to look like this (watch video in recipe card to see the consistency). If your stove top doesn't go very low it might not take as much time. Add the cream and lemon juice and mix through.</li>
    </ol>
